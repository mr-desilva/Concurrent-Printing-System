# Concurrent-Printing-System

Developing an FSP program to model a system of several students that share a printer to print documents and two technicians. One technician refills the paper when it has run out and one technician replaces the toner cartridge when it runs out. In addition, produce a Java implementation of the printing system, using the appropriate Java concurrency features: threads, thread groups and a monitor.

Project consist of three parts,
- Develop FSP processes to model the shared printer.
- This abstract FSP program is then to be translated into a multi-threaded Java program, using appropriate Java concurrency features. The Java program is to be based on the FSP model of the printing system. You are required to develop Java classes to model the FSP processes and the complete system defined in part 1.
- Provide screen shots of the FSP model in the LTSA tool & an example of a sample output from the Java program.
